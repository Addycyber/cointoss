# cointoss
A fun and interactive Python application built with PyQt5 that simulates coin tosses. Users can specify the number of tosses, view individual results, and see a summary with counts and percentages for "Heads" and "Tails." This project is an engaging way to practice randomization, loops, and GUI development in Python.
